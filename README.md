## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's generally considered more effective to approach design from a mobile-first perspective. I learned this lesson firsthand during this challenge when I initially designed for desktop, placing the featured image in a container with padding. However, when I later attempted to design the mobile page, I encountered difficulties because I couldn't remove the padding without affecting other elements that depended on it. Consequently, I had to completely redo the design with a mobile-first approach.

Neat way to add spacing / margin between the elements.
```css
/* Lobotomized owl */
main *+* {
    margin-top: 1.75rem;
}
```


### Continued development

Improve on:
- HTML layout
- Flexbox
- Grid
